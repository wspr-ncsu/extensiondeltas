This extension makes all html textareas into a very stripped-down version of Vi[m]. It's modal, supports infinite undo, has register support, search, visual mode, and various movement and editing commands. There's a lot yet to implement, but I've tried to cover all the basics that you'd use every day to type an email, edit a wiki page, etc. That being said, you'll note that the version number hasn't hit 1.0 yet.

If you like the power of ItsAllText, but want something a bit lighter-weight, give it a try.

This is a direct port of jV 0.51 for Firefox [https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/jv/] done in my 20% time at Google.  It should be exactly feature-compatible, except that on Linux it doesn't support the selection register "*.

Thanks to Marsette Vona (martyvona@gmail.com) for experimental support for editing in the new GMail compose div in 0.56!
