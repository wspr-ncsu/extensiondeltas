This extension enables you to look up and translate English words in real time even as you watch YouTube, NetFlix or Ted.com.

Select the word or even an entire idiom you want to look up and use the Save function to enable highlighting for future passive learning in different contexts. Learning in context has been proven to be the most effective method for acquiring vocabulary in any languages!

This extension will be a useful companion for those who love reading online news and watching movies.
