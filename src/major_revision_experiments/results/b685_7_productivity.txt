E-resources provided by HKUL require a fee subscription.  Access via Find@HKUL or the Electronic Resources page would direct you through our EZProxy server prompting user login.  Upon successful login, access will be granted.  Access from a non-HKUL website, such as Google Scholar or a Publisherâ€™s website, would not trigger the HKUL login page, and you will be asked to pay for access.  To identify your affiliation with HKUL, you will need to route via the EZProxy server.  

A special thanks to Mr. Yang Cao who contributed the code to us.
