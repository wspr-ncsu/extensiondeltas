MyEtherWallet Chrome Extension / MEW CX

Browse the blockchain. Bring your own MEW.

The fully redesigned MEW CX brings full MEW functionality and Web3 support to your browser toolbar! Send transactions, interact with DApps, save wallets in your browser, swap crypto, and manage your tokens all from our new browser extension.

The option to choose different wallets for different DApps and the burn address function let you explore the decentralized internet with confidence. Best of all, our CX stays true to MEW ideals by remaining a 100% free, open-source, and client-side tool.

Removing MEW CX will cause your saved wallets to reset, so only remove this extension as a last resort. It can be temporary disabled from your browser's extension page.
