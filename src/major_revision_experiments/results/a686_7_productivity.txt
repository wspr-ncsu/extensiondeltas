Hello man! Are you a fan of Bob Marley? Do you like the Jamaican way of life and the message in his songs? Mee too.

That's why I created this Chrome extension, to make my life easier and to feed the Marley's fan inside me :) Hope you like it.

Features:
- each tab you get a new Bob Marley image that you'll love
- each day a new inspirational quote
- speed dial
- super easy usability to navigate through Bookmarks, Apps, Most Visited and Last Visited. Just mouse over them...
-not the last, Google search form. Efficiency, man!

If you need more features, let me know.
If you like it, let me know (and give me a 5* review :))

Why the app needs those permissions?
To be able to display in a friendly format the bookmarks, apps, most and last visited sites, the extension needs access to read them before displaying.

How to uninstall it?
Go to toolbar and write: chrome://extensions. Go to Bob Marley New Tab and uninstall it. No trouble, man!
