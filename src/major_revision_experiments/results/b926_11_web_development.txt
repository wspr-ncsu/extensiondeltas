test refresh is a responsive web design development testing tool. Working in conjunction with an iOS and android app, it allows you to specify a tab within chrome that you wish to monitor.

Once monitoring, any page reload or on-site click will automatically load or refresh that page on your mobile device, allowing you to instantly see the mobile-rendering of your page as soon as you refresh it on your desktop.

It is designed to help you quickly test your responsive web designs by allowing you to test on desktop and mobile without requiring you to manually refresh your mobile browser screen.

It is also designed to work without an internet connection - as long as your desktop and mobile are on the same network, and can see the same URLs, you can automatically link the two devices to help you develop more effectively.
