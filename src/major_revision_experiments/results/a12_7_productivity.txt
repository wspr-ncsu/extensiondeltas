Flexible extension that provides a link to several Wikimedia projects, keeps track of new items on your watchlists and allows you to search wikis from your omni-bar.

The extension can link to the wiki project home page, your watchlist, a random page or WikiHub. The page can open in either a new tab or your current tab.

Wiki projects can be searched from the omni-bar by typing "wiki" followed by a space and your search.

You can select any Wikimedia supported languages for the extension to be linked to. You can also customise your watchlist settings in the extension so that they are set every time you visit your watchlist through the extension.

The extension also keeps track of new items on your watchlist and shows you the number of items added to your watchlist since your last visit via the plugin. This feature can be turned off and the frequency of checking set to save data usage when you are paying per-MB.
