Do you work for long periods of time and forget to take regular breaks?
Break helper reminds you to take a break with a notification and helps you track your progress with timers and statistics page.

How to use
To start using Break Helper you don't really need to do anything, just install it. The default settings use Pomodoro technique (25 minutes of work and 5 minutes of break time). If you want to change these settings to other preprogrammed techniques (like 20-20-20 or 50-10) or design your own custom technique, just click on the Break helper icon and inside the popup click "Preferences". You will be redirected to a Options page where you can set your configuration.

To check how much time is left until the next break simply click on Break helper icon and inside the popup you will find a timer that tells you how much time is left until the next break.
