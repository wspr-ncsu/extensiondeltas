Send hundreds of emails to recipients individually. Like a newsletter or a birthday invitation. All in Fastmail.

LIMITS

Check your Fastmail limits for accurate information. The Basic plan can send 1000 emails at a time.

ROADMAP

- Mail merge: Use ${firstname} type of variables from CSV or Google Sheets.
- Auto-followup: if your contact hasn't replied in two days, send an automatic followup (queue).
- Track opens and clicks
- In depth analytics (optional of course)
- Team plans

TROUBLESHOOTING

- Emails that fail to send are left in the draft for your review.
- Generally it's a good idea to add yourself to the newsletter just to confirm everything works.
- It's normal that 100 emails take (exactly) a minute to send, we tempo it down so no Fastmail filters are triggered.
