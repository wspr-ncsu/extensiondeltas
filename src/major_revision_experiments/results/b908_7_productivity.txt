Newt was designed to be a simple, lightweight replacement for Google Chrome's New Tab page. It gives you easy access to your favorite websites without any of that other clutter or special effects. Your installed Chrome apps are just a tap away.

Newt uses your a special bookmarks folder to populate your new tab page. This makes it very easy to set up. Another benefit to this method is that your categories and websites will be synced to your Google Account*! This means that you only need to set up Newt once and it will be the same on all your other computers. You'll also be able to easily access these sites from Chrome on your mobile devices. In addition to bookmarks, Newt also displays your installed apps, Most Visited sites, Recently Added bookmarks, Recently Closed tabs, and tabs from Chrome on your other devices.

Theme Builder

Newt uses a custom in-app theme builder that let's you customize all of the colors. To access it, click on the '+' icon next to the theme list in Settings. This will bring up the theme builder on the right side of your screen. You'll see some values already filled in to give you an idea of what to do. You can use any method of defining a color: predefined color words, hex, rgb, rgba. When you enter a color, the respective parts of the app will update. Yes, there is instant feedback with every change. Once you're happy, click 'Save' and it will be added to your list of themes. You can build and add as many as you'd like.

With this freedom, it's possible to create a theme that interferes with your use of the app. If this happens, go to the Newt options page from Chrome's Extensions page and click the reset button. This will change the active theme to the very safe Light theme.

Existing Newt user?

You may have noticed that the old Newt app was renamed 'Newt Classic'. Since this new version is so different from the old, I thought it would be best to not just overwrite the original. Some people may prefer that style to the new one. If you want to import your existing Newt data, just go in to Chrome's Bookmark Manager and rename your 'Newt' folder to 'NewtData'.
