This extension is pretty much a way of being more efficient when looking at lots of real estate listings.  The process of buying a property is already painful enough, this extension allows you to very quickly and easily pull up Google Map directions from your place of employment to the property you might be looking at.  You can even include a spouse's place of employment as well so you can simultaneously check on your commutes.
