This extension allows you to sift through your tabs, search them and switch to a particular one. This is extremely useful if you find yourself opening up 100's of tabs everyday.

Let me know what you think. Any feedback is appreciated.

Keyboard shortcut to open the popup - Ctrl + Shift + K (windows) / Command + Shift + K (mac)
