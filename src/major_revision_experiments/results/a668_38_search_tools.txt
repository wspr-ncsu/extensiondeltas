Clicking the extension icon prompts a popup which shows you information of the restaurant you are viewing on OpenTable from Yelp. The popup includes the rating, number of reviews, three photos, and three review excerpt of the restaurant from Yelp. It also includes a link to the restaurant's page on Yelp for easy access. 

With this extension, you no longer need to search the restaurant on Yelp by yourself! It has been done for you!
