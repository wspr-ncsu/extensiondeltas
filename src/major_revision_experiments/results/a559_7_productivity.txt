Requires a FoxyProxy account from https://getfoxyproxy.org. Choose from 100 different countries; thousands of different cities. Geoshifting moves your computer's physical location (virtually) to another city or country. Websites that are blocked because of your location are unblocked when you geoshift.

What some of our customers say:

"We advertise in all major markets within the USA, EU and are opening up to Oceania. We use FoxyProxy to QA and test our global advertising product."

"We need to regularly visit certain websites from multiple countries in order to check that targeted-to-specific-country advertisement tags work."

"We are launching a few websites that are geo-filtered and have local offerings by territory. We need the ability to check the setup of these sites from time to time and confirm changes made are accurate."

"Our mobile application has a legal requirement to display specific disclaimers in specific countries. We use FoxyProxy to test that our GeoLocation (IP-based) systems can correctly identify the country and present the correct disclaimer."
