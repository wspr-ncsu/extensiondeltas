What's new in 0.3: We removed RTM's cow from our logo and icon, because of RTM's branding policy.

What's new in 0.1: Partly support pages of Chrome Web Store. Plugin can't get selection in Chrome Store pages, but can add task with page title as a task name.

More info about the extension:

You may know the "Quick Add"-bookmarklet [ https://www.rememberthemilk.com/help/?ctx=quickadd.whatis ], that allows quickly add tasks to RTM. Unfortunately it doesn't include URL of based webpage.

This extension solves this problem. It based on simple bookmarklet described in the tip: [ http://www.rememberthemilk.com/forums/tips/3133/ ]. Extension just wraps that bookmarklet, but it doesn't need additional bookmark panel or over clicks for using. It's displayed near the address bar thats why it's much more convenient.

This product uses the Remember The Milk page but is not endorsed or certified by Remember The Milk. It doesn't use Remember The Milk API.
