Focusly allows you to limit distractions when you want to focus. 

Using the extension is simple and intuitive:
- Add or removed sites from your list.
- Set a timer, and restrict your access to those sites for that amount of time.
- If you must end the timer early, enter a series of characters to regain access to the blocked sites.
