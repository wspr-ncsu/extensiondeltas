IMPORTANT EDIT: I released an iOS and Android App called Mood Pixel. Once I have finished the app I will redo this extension completely and synchronise Moodflow with Mood Pixel.

MEDITATE. REFLECT. MOTIVATE.

That is the core of moodflow, your personal dashboard that offers stunning images of the most exotic places on earth.

moodflow has 4 goals: 

    - To KEEP YOU MOTIVATED with a handpicked and curated list of the best motivational videos.

    - To help you IDENTIFY WHAT MAKES YOU HAPPY by getting your feedback on your inner-wellbeing.

    - To KEEP YOUR SPIRIT BALANCED by providing you with an environment of relaxation to escape reality.

    - To MAINTAIN YOUR FOCUS on the important things that you have to achieve today.



Other features:
*** To-do List ***
*** Beautiful layout no matter what screen size ***
*** Customize the interval in which the background changes ***
*** Customize the dashboard layout to make it look extra-clean***

Cooming-soon:
