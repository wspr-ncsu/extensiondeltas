Three Hub is an open source Chrome Extension that shows the 3D models from the model files when browsing GitHub.

This extends the native support GitHub launched for stl format a few months ago: https://github.com/blog/1465-stl-file-viewing

Currently only obj formats are supported, however this is by far the most popular 3D format on github, with over 195 thousand files listed against 22 thousand stl files.
