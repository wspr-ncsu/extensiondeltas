Cookie Jar is a simple extension that allows you to visit your favorite websites without sharing this information with third parties (e.g. social networks, advertising networks, and analytics platform).
Cookie Jar functions by removing cookies sent to websites that are hosted on a different root domain than the website you are visiting.
