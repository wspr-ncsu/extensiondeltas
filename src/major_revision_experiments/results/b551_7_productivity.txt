Social media making you antisocial? Sick of getting drawn into arguments on some forum? Wasting time on some terrible "news" site instead of doing literally anything else?

Ever wanted to just delete a website and never visit it again?

This simple extension does just that! Simply press the delete button and the website will be deleted*. Visit the site again and you'll just see an error page. What a relief! Now you can do something productive instead.

Come up with a witty retort after deleting a site in anger? Just hit the button again and the extension will dig the site out of the trash, dust it off and it's good as new.

* Deleted sites are added to a list, redirecting you to a standard-looking error page. Unfortunately (as much as we would sometimes like to) we can't really delete entire web sites.
