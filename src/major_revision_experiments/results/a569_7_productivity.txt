Alpharabi.us is a Chrome extension that swaps out words in the articles of your favorite sites to encourage you to passively learn foreign language vocabulary.

Additionally, you can log in to the web app to get quizzed on your new vocabulary at the end of each article and in the alpharabi.us dashboard.
