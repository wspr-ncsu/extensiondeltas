Tab Group allows users to create groupings of links/urls/internet pages. Users can easily create new groupings by entering a name and description for the group and adding links to them. They can also pull all the links from currently opened tabs. Users can choose to open the items within the indicated grouping all at once in different tabs. Very useful when opening the browser depending on specific purposes (groups can contain things you might want to differentiate ie: fun and games, work, coding, readings, art history class, trip planning).
