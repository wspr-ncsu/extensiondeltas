==Observation

When I ask users of AWS to navigate to a specific AWS service, the user typically takes a few seconds sinking in on the overwhelming number of services in the console page, subsequently entering the service name via Ctrl-F to find where to click.

==Problem

Too many service. Too difficult to find where the link is. Why is there no simple seach bar?

==Solution

Naturally, based on the observation, let's build a AWS Launcher that has search capability to help easily launch specific AWS services console.

==Features

* Instant Search to launching AWS services - no more scanning the console home page to see where to click
* Enter to launch first listed service - type and enter and launch - don't need to use the mouse to click and launch

==Further Work

* save state
* MRU
* settings
