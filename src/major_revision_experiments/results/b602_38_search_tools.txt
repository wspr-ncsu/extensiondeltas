This extension sets your search engine to Usseek Donate and customizes your new tab page so you can help small businesses with every search.

How it works:

Donate Search is a search engine like Google, but very different: we use a portion of our ad revenue to contribute to charities that help small businesses that have been hurt from the Covid-19 lockdown and resulting drop in business.  

You already use your browser every day to search the internet- Why not also raise funds while doing this? Our free extension lets you raise funds and help others while doing the same searches you normally do. 

Help get the word out! Share this page with your friends and ask them to also install this extension, so we can maximize the funds we raise to help our small businesses in need!
