This plugin allows you to be more productive, and it doesn't waste your time while doing so.

You can with ease dictate the time you want to be blocked from a website, and even allow yourself in only on weekends so you don't unblock yourself, and "forget" to block yourself again!

Feature suggestions are encouraged, but I will only implement features which makes this plugin simpler to use.
