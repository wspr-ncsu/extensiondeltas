INBOX COMMENTS

Inbox Comments lets you collaborate with your team on any email thread in Gmail with comments, @mentioning, and more. Get help from teammates and work together on email responses in real-time.

Revenue teams spend a large percentage of their workday in their inbox, communicating with prospects and customers. But the process of collaborating on an email thread still requires forwarding it to a team member, jumping on Slack, or walking across the office. This throws you off your game, reduces productivity, and delays your response time. 

With Inbox Comments you can tap into your team's expertise right from the very tool you use to communicate - your inbox. 

Say a prospect has an objection or a customer has a challenging question; simply start a conversation with a team member alongside your email thread. You don't have to jump to a new platform and any context they need is right there in your email thread. 

INBOX COMMENTS FEATURES:

* Real-time collaboration right inside of Gmail
* Simply highlight any text to add a comment or start a conversation
* @mention team members to add them to the conversation
* Add more detail with attachments and emojis 
* Share email threads without having to Cc/Bcc/Forward
