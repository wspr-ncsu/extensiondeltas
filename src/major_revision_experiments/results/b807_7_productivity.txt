“Finally, a Help Desk Solution that focuses on what matters: Time.” 

Track Time Across Your Business. Automatically Generate Invoices. Make Smarter Decisions. 

Why focus on time? 

SherpaDesk is built for folks who focus on time. Most consultants (like us when we launched!) use hours-worked as a key variable in their business. Hours serve as the basis for invoicing, resource allocation, asset replacement, and of course...revenue. 

What about HelpDesk? 

Let’s be clear. We’ve built a robust help-desk solution and we know how important it is to centralize client issues and respond to customers in near-record time. 

Hundreds of customers use SherpaDesk as their go-to help desk solution. Yet when we ask our customers what they love about SherpaDesk, it’s how time appears in every corner of our solution. Hours-worked, after all, guides questions around profit, resource allocation, and brings transparency to customer interactions.
