This tool let you share the content of your clipboard by using a secret URL.

I like to share images. But before sharing, I like to annotate them, crop a little bit, add some color, and then share. I'm not particularly eager to embed images in Excel sheets, Documents, or Emails; I always prefer to share a link.
Not only that, sometimes I want to see the history of all images I already shared, or blur faces, or highlight a specific part of the pages. Using arrows, circles, and rectangles. That's why I the Control V tool.
Today the storage cost is so low that I promise never to delete your images. 

I hope you will enjoy using the tool, at least like I enjoyed to create it.
