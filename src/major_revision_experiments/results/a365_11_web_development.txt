With Switcheroo Plus, you can redirect any http request, no matter if entered manually or from elements of your page (i.e. images, scripts, css, and so on).

This enables you to quickly switch i.e. between a test/developer server and a live server.

Switcheroo Redirector Plus differs from 'normal' Switcheroo Redirector by several enhancements, like:

- regex support
- improved GUI
- internationalized
- import and export of rules
- options page (easier when switching tabs)
