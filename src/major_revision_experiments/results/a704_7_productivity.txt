Heard of ObamaCare, and Healthcare.gov?  The problem with this new healthcare exchange is that it is almost impossible to understand the final cost of your  insurance plan.  Premiums, Co-Payments, Co-Insurance, Deductibles, Max-Out-Of-Pocket....what do all these terms mean, and more importantly, how much will they cost you?

ObummerCare is a Chrome browser extension that you can activate when you are comparing plans on Healthcare.gov.  With a little bit of information, ObummerCare will estimate the total cost of insurance plans for the next year and present them in order from the least expensive, to the most expensive.  With ObummerCare you can save money by selecting the right plan, and you'll have a pretty good idea of what you should expect to spend over the next year, too.
