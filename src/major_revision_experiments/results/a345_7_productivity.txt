A simple yet powerful window layout resizer for the browser window. This extension enables the user to adjust the current window's layout size based on the pre-defined set or any new custom dimension. Each dimension is visually shown in a toolbar popup for easy access. The extension gets left, top, right and bottom positions in percent unit and changes the window size to these values. This extension detects all monitors in your system and allows one of the monitors to be the reference for the alignment. Also, this extension supports keyboard shortcuts for the first 6 alignments in the popup. It means that you can re-align to any of these 6 alignments without opening the popup and just by pressing a user-defined keyboard set. Each item in the popup is draggable. The user can change the arrangement of the items or even remove or add new items.

Note: This extension uses a non-persistent background script to be completely idle when it is not being used.
