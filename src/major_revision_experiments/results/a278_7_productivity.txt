An extension to poll each minute and show geographical details about your current IP.

The extension icon will be the country flag where your IP is found to be located.

The extension polls every minute in case your IP changes (e.g. you lose VPN connection).  The flag will update when this occurs (assuming the new IP is in another country)

You will see details such as city, country code, region, zip, your ISP and Organization for the IP.

An image on Google Maps showing the location of the IP will be displayed at the bottom.
