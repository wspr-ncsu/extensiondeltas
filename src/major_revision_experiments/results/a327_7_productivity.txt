A new tab page that helps you focus on completing your goals at work. 
Use your countdown timer to keep yourself on track by setting a goal for how long you want to work on each task.
The extension icon shows a badge that displays how much time you have remaining to complete your current task.
This extension also records the number of tasks you've completed every day (called "streaks") so you can compare your productivity every day to your average working day.
