A digital assistant which helps you get more sales from your Poshmark closet, while you go truly hands-free. It can help you with sharing, following closets and takes regular breaks.

* How it works?

Stacy Digital Assistant is designed to work like a human. Working and taking breaks every now and then. You can see exactly what Stacy is doing to help boost your Poshmark sales from your closet.

* Features of the assistant

- Human-like behavior
- Sharing your closet items to followers / party
- Sharing any closet item to followers / party
- Warns you when you share too much
- Adjust preferences if you really want a boost
- Pause + Resume
- Tracks your stats

* Why Stacy?

Stacy is designed to act like a human. It will NOT share your items in a fast or spam-like manner, as this can cause your activity to go overboard and may end you up in a Share Jail! 

Stacy will replicate what a human already does by hand, so you can go truly hands-free and are protected from Share Jail!
