Hint a stored bookmarklet

1. Setup bookmarklet title and URL
2. Hint a bookmarklet with similar URL: http://your.web.app.com/?bmlet=Bookmarklet

Hint a bookmarklet is present as query parameter

1. Pass html + uri encoded bookmarklet

https://www.google.com/?bmlet=javascript%3Adocument.write(%26%2339%3B%26lt%3Bh1%26gt%3BThank%20you%20for%20downloading%26lt%3B%2Fh1%26gt%3B%26%2339%3B)%3B

Sometimes a bookmarklet may refresh the page or take you to a different destination, you may use "bmlet" and "bmlet-2" parameters to perform multiple actions.
