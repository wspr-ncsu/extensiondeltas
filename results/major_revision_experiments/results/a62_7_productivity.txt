Usage to scroll through your open tabs
----------------------------------------

Way 1 : Press ALT Key + mouse wheel
Way 2 : Press mouse right button + mouse wheel

When you scroll your mouse has to be anywhere over the page but not over the tabs.

Also, if you once disabled the extension and re-enable it, all the tabs has to be reloaded to register the event (restart chrome is fine).

Where it works
---------------
It's working on every pages with real content loaded EXCEPT internal "chrome://" pages or "https://chrome.google.com/*" pages.
