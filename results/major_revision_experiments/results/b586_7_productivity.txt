Gamasutra Beautifier is a tiny extension that tries to bring Gamasutra.com design to the 21st century.

This extension grew out of my frustration of browsing Gamasutra.com. 

The website holds a trove of valuable information for game developers and game development enthousiasts, hidden under an out-of-date design, which hinders readability.

I started applying some custom CSS rules in the article pages of Gamasutra.com which I expanded on the homepage and listing pages of the site.

This should not be considered by any way a suggested redesign, but just a way to make the site more readable.

In that sense, I haven't also removed any of the banners from the website.
