When Everykey is close to your phone, laptop, tablet, house, car, or another access-controlled device, it unlocks that device. When you walk away, that device locks back down. Everykey can also log you into your website accounts and generate secure passwords for new website accounts. If you lose your Everykey, you can remotely freeze it, so no one else can use it.
