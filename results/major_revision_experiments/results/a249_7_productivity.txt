Chrome Extension for working with Twitch TV and KBMOD's MultiStream tool (https://multistre.am)

All KBMOD MultiStream code reference/influence and icon usage belongs to KBMOD - www.kbmod.com.

This tool is intended to provide a few shortcuts for those who still use the main Twitch TV website, but would like to quickly and easily switch to KBMOD MultiStream from either a single channel (via hyperlink context menu), or up to 6 channels via the Extension button popup.

When enter channel names in the extension's popup your entries will be saved to local storage. This will enable you to browse to multiple Twitch pages and click the '+' button to add that stream, while persisting your previous additions despite the popup dissapearing.
