Easily re-open your closed tabs, from seconds ago to months ago. Closed tabs are shown in a dropdown for quick access to recent items, but you can search the full history.

You can clear the tab history at any time with a single click as well to preserve privacy or clear out old data.

This extension is a fork of Sexy Undo Close Tabs, a great extension the author has abandoned. In current form it is nearly identical to the old extension but with ads insertion removed.
