A chrome extension that checks the response headers of the active tab and tries to determine if it is being served via a CDN.

This is designed to make lives easier for people, so you don't have to keep checking the network panel.

At the moment, it only works with AWS CloudFront.

It does track HIT & MISS data by reporting custom page views to Google Analytics - this can now be disabled via the options.

Options also provides a way to change the Google Analytics account being used for tracking if you want to use your own.
