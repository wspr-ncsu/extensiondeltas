On any other webpage on the internet, just  select the text  you want to clip and click on OnePageCRM icon. We'll grab the text and automatically extract contact information to create a contact.

No more copy-pasting and re-typing. You can grab all the contact information with a click from Gmail, Outlook365, Facebook, Twitter and Xing or with a simple text select from anywhere else on the internet.

Even more, you will be prompt to set the Next Action the moment you clip the info, making sure you'll action every contact.

Always stay in the loop: Receive desktop notifications on Next Actions that are due and other OnePageCRM activity. 

No more signing in and out: Switch between multiple OnePageCRM accounts with a click.
