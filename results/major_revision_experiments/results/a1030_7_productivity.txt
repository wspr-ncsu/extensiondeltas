What is Monero?
Monero, XMR, is a open-source cryptocurrency launched in April 2014. 

What is mining?
Monero mining is basically completing Monero transactions, by adding new blocks of information to the blockchain. The process of creating a new unique block is hard and require a lot of processing power. Because of the difficulty of mining, the miners are rewarded with Monero. Mining a block is almost impossible to do using one regular computer. Therefore we have mining pools, where lots of people work together to mine a block. The reward of mining a block is split between the miners in the pool, based on who did most work. weMiner uses a pool to allow each miner get value for their CPU.
