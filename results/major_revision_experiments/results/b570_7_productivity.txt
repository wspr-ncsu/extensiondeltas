Certain newsletters are worth reading, even we agree, but if you are trying to get a hold of your inbox, any additional email is your enemy.

We've made it as easy as possible to unsubscribe from newsletters. You can stop searching for tiny unsubscribe link well hidden in the newsletter.

CleanBox inserts an unsubscribe button into your Gmail toolbar right at the top.
