1.3.1 Update: .eu support site
1.3.0 Update: Now saving history is back
Add "More" instead of "View All" for Trip and Charge log to load more log entries.
Add "Save all" button for Trip and Charge log to save full log as .json file.
Note: It will show and save as many entries as there are on server. Ford deletes old entries (I think only last 100 are available)
