This is a way to look at Local Storage in the Dev Tools when the storage is being encrypted with LZString.js (https://github.com/pieroxy/lz-string). Also might be useful since it pretty prints JSON (double click on any row to get the Pretty Printed value). Very feature bare, banged out in a couple of hours as a tool I needed.  The source is available on Github (https://github.com/kriserickson/lz-localstorage-chrome-extension)
