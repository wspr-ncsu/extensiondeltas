ABOUT
 
Download AdBlock’s free ad blocker to block ads everywhere on the web. AdBlock also protects your browser from malware and stops advertisers from accessing your browsing history and personal information.

AdBlock for Chrome works automatically. Just click "Add to Chrome," then visit your favorite website and see the ads disappear! Choose to continue seeing unobtrusive ads, whitelist your favorite sites, or block all ads by default.

AdBlock participates in the Acceptable Ads program, so unobtrusive ads are not blocked by default in order to support websites. We believe users should control what they see on the web, so you can easily opt out in AdBlock’s settings.

USER REVIEWS

Almira Tamar - ★★★★★
“Have used it for god knows how long. By far the best adblock i've ever used.”

Jo MR - ★★★★★
“Works awesome even with the free version, so I'm even happier to support them. AdBlock has made my work so much easier for years. I especially like the "pictures" features, where instead of ads I get to see cats, and nature, and puppies. Works really well on all sites, it's easy to customize and it provides a safer navigation experience. Why should we get bombed with ads everywhere? It's exhausting. 
Thanks AdBlock Team!

Arik Akon - ★★★★★
“I Downloaded a few adblockers, to see which was best. i left it for a month when i came to check on it. So far, the others have done nearly a few thousand, like 2000 ads blocked so far. But this one reaches 11 000! Absolutely suggest this above all!”
