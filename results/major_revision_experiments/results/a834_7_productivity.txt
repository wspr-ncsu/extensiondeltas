If you're spending too much time on Facebook, this is a nice passive way to gently discourage your habit. If you haven't visited Facebook at all in the last four hours, it will appear as normal. But as the minutes tick by, the site will become dimmer and dimmer, until, after an hour, it is completely invisible, and you'll have to wait another four hours for it to return to full strength.
