*Update* Spotify appear to have fully disabled the old player and there is no workaround that I know of currently. I'll update this plugin if a fix becomes available, but until then the new web player is the only option. Sorry, I did my best, but ultimately it is Spotify's decision.

Please leave a support comment if you're aware of a new fix :)

------

Turns open.spotify.com into the play.spotify.com that you know and love, complete with features such as:
* Radio
* One-click playlist access
* Fully featured search
* And much more!

Disable that new Spotify Web Player and get your music back!

How does it work?
Changes your UserAgent so you look like you're using Internet Explorer 11, rather than Chrome. Essentially a more user-friendly implementation of the process described here: https://community.spotify.com/t5/Desktop-Linux-Windows-Web-Player/New-Spotify-Web-Player-Design-NEW-2017-DESIGN-FEEDBACK-IDEAS/m-p/1641377#M184605

Does it change my UserAgent for any other websites?
No. This will only changes your UserAgent on play.spotify.com and open.spotify.com. Will not change your requests to any other websites in any way.

Works while it works, but Spotify may choose to turn off the old interface at any point. If that happens this extension will no longer work.
