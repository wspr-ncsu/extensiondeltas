Frequently Asked Questions:

What is Awesome HQ?
Awesome HQ is both the name of this product and our company. It's a productivity tool that can be used as a home page, dashboard, or new tab page. It's currently in a limited beta, and will gain additional features over time.

Is an account required?
Yes. You are currently required to login with your Google account to fully utilize Awesome HQ. Without an account, you can not make any changes.

How is Awesome HQ different from Awesome New Tab Page?
Awesome New Tab Page runs on your computer. No account or internet connection required. However, if you install it on another computer, your settings are stuck isolated. No synchronization. Awesome HQ runs on our servers, so you need an internet connection. However, Awesome HQ works in all modern browsers and even on your smartphone. Just login with the same account on each of your browsers/devices, and you're good to go!
