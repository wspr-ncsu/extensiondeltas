There are a lot of links provide in Github pages. Some might need to be marked as read, some you find amazing & some you would love to read it later. Github Marker does exactly that.
The extension provides 3 options attached to every link found on github related pages:
1. Mark as Read/Unread
2. Favorite/Un-Favorite a link
3. Bookmark/Unbookmark a link

Note: The extension is currently only supported for Github pages. As per user request it can be extended to other plateforms.
