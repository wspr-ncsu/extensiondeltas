Do you keep your browser minimized when you're working? Tired of periodically checking the browser for unread notifications from Facebook, Twitter, Gmail, Quora, Linkedin and others?

This extension checks all your open tabs for unread notifications, as an example - a tab with a title of "(1) Facebook" means that you have 1 unread notification on that website.

Whenever an unread notification is found in any open tab, the webcam is turned on & off periodically - which inturn blinks its LED indicator. Use this as an out of screen visual cue to check your browser, free from any other distraction.

* Requires permission to access your webcam (please use the options page to grant access, it can be revoked similarly).

* NOTE TO USERS
- This extension does not record, save or use your webcam, it just turns it on and off and ignores the data.
