A Chrome extension to locate and highlight image search results in their original page. The highlight can be configured via the Options page (which can be accessed by clicking the eyes in the omnibar when you've searched for some images).

It can also permanently revert Google's image search behaviour back to how it used to work with results displayed on multiple pages.

Note: Finding the image in the page does not work 100% of the time. I hope to improve this in subsequent versions. Occasionally the shadow highlight can't be displayed or is only partially displayed. Unfortunately this is beyond my capability to fix!
