Wordly is a lexicon to help you improve your english.

It has been demonstrated on Psychological and Neurolinguistic studies the unique way to language mastery (above certain level) is to have a wide enough range of words you can command and use like a native speaker.

The best way to acquire a bigger lexicon to use is not to read the dictionary. (That can work too but it's impractical for the 95% of the people, and certainly not even the 5% wants to read the dictionary). The best way is to command words is to learn them on the context you found them and to use them from then onwards.
 

You can extend your English just by using it passively. Or if you're on a learning sprint you can try the intense mode.

How does it work?

Add words seamlessly with our chrome and iOS extension. Right click and "--> Save to Wordly" once you have authenticated yourself.

Get 5 words and descriptions in an email once a week.
Use those 5 words for 1 week.
And reap the rewards.
Yes, it's that simple. And works.

We will be launching an intense mode where you get 5 words a day. On the intense mode the learning is accelerated - but obviously requires more of your commitment than the other mode.
