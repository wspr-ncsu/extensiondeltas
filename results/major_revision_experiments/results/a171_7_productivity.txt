Iwantoknow.me monitors browser activities, then organizes and presents the data collected in a simple and intuitive way. The responsive interface allows users to accurately identify the time spent at browsing different sites using the graph. Iwantoknow.me also comes in handy when the users intend to tune their lifestyle by notifying the users whenever too much time is spent on a certain domain. What makes it stands out is that when the users overspent their time on the Internet or a certain pages, Iwantoknow.me will notify the users regarding the overspent issue rather than blocking the selected browser. We purposely designed it this way because the users might need to use the blocked website for important matters.
