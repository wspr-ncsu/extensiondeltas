It is difficult to believe what we find online. Even harder to make real-life decisions based on that information. Reasonal provides the information and context for you to make informed decisions based on what you read or watch online. 

Reasonal AI provides additional markers for content and websites:

 1. Links and Websites that are consistently referenced on the web are marked as ðŸ”µ Stable.
 2. Links and Websites that have their references removed occasionally on the web are marked as ðŸŸ¡ Curved.
 3. Links and Websites that have their references removed regularly on the web are marked as ðŸŸ  Winding.

You can also contribute your knowledge to Reasonal platform by updating Reasonal entries for any link and add additional links and content to each entry.
 
Currently, Reasonal Browser extension provides this information for Twitter, Facebook, and Google News with support for more websites coming soon.
