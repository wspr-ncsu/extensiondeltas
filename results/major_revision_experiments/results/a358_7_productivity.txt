Let's face it, there is a lot of clickbait out there. There are many site's whose entire existence is to create inflamed article titles so that you click on them. Sometimes, it is easy to know that there are to be ignored, sometimes it is more difficult.

The list of sites is free and available on GitHubâ€” additions or removals are welcome on the GitHub repository:
