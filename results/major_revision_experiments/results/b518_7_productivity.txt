Check Less helps you spend time more efficiently every day, by giving you a certain number of periods during which you can use time-wasting websites.

1) Add a site that you'd like to check less.
2) Check Less will limit the number of times and length of time you use the site.

After you hit your limit, you'll be blocked until the next day.
