Find yourself constantly copying and pasting from JIRA into an email to update your boss/colleagues about an issue? This plugin adds a clipboard icon to your browser that takes the details from the current tab (in browse or search mode) and puts it into your clipboard.

You can also open multiple tabs and copy all the details into a bulletted list.
